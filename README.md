# ðŸ“¸ CNN Image Classification with CIFAR-10

This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify images from the 
[CIFAR-10 dataset](https://github.com/YoongiKim/CIFAR-10-images) into predefined categories.
It involves building and training a deep learning model and comparing its performance to a simpler baseline model.

 # âœ… Tasks

- Select 4 classes from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Design and train a CNN model (custom or based on existing architecture).
- Compare its performance against a simple CNN model:
  - 1 convolutional layer (non-overlapping filters)
  - 1 average pooling layer
  - Fully connected neural network
